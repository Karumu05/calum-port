              I am very open and honest, and I believe everyone has the right
              to be heard on any matter. I have always been an incredibly
              inquisitive person. Whenever I have had an issue, question, or
              doubt why something is, you can be sure I will ask why. If you
              ask any of my school teachers, I&apos;m sure they would agree. I
              don&apos;t see the point in being confused when people and
              resources are available everywhere to quench the thirst for
              inquisitiveness.{" "}

              I have experienced many hardships in life, just as I am sure
              many others have. I believe it is important to learn from
              life&apos;s lessons and move forward with new knowledge in hopes
              of being prepared for future events or becoming wise enough to
              prevent them from happening again. With this in mind, although
              sometimes with extreme difficulty, I think it is essential to
              look at one&apos;s life in detail and try to think about the
              question &quot;What if&quot; as much as possible in all aspects
              of life.{" "}

              As you can probably tell, I am a big fan of communication. I
              think it is important in all aspects of life, from personal to
              work. Effective communication not only helps get a task done but
              also helps each other understand thoughts and feelings regarding
              whatever situation. Through good communication, problems can
              become easier to solve and help ensure everyone is happy, and
              thus, in my opinion, produce better results for everyone.

              Although I love to talk and interact with people, I also respect
              when they don&apos;t. Everyone is different, and I believe that
              everyone feels comfortable communicating with themselves or
              others in the right situation, time, and place. Respecting
              people&apos;s differences and communication methods is very
              important and a hard skill to learn. I hope that as my life
              continues, I can continue to develop my communication skills and
              help not only myself but also others.{" "}

              I aim to work in an environment where these values shine
              through. Clear and respectful communication is very important to
              achieve. I would hope that all workplaces strive for this value
              to develop a trusting team that can work under trust and provide
              outstanding results.
