              I wasn&apos;t always coding! My love affair with Japan started in
              Primary school. I quickly needed to know more. This fascination
              led me to delve deeper into high school, where I mastered two
              Japanese writing systems, Hiragana and Katakana. Then, I
              encountered Kanji, which some may see as daunting. I saw it as
              exciting and a challenge, which I am still tackling to this day.
              Learning Kanji perfectly matches my passion for continuous
              learning, or kaizen, as many Japanese firms would say.

              Fast-forward to Tokyo‚Äîliving the dream and surrounded by tech
              innovation. After securing a spot at the University of Manchester,
              I finally landed in Tokyo. Fueled by my goal of speaking Japanese
              fluently, after six months of nonstop talking to anyone who would
              entertain me, I could finally immerse myself in Japanese society
              and the vibrant tech scene. From trains delivering sushi to my
              table to captivating 3D billboards, Japan sparked a new passion.

              Back in the UK, from festivals to code, the magic of seeing a
              Dev&apos;s creations come to life. Returning to complete my
              dissertation through the challenges of COVID-19, I graduated and
              started working at UK festivals. Working in the EPOS team, I rose
              to Project Manager, gaining valuable tech knowledge and people
              skills. I wanted to know more. Seeing the use of the
              developer&apos;s code on large-scale events ignited a passion to
              learn more about software development.

              Determined to become a software developer, I enrolled at
              Northcoders, where I leveraged my language-learning skills to
              conquer new coding challenges. Here, I came to grips with the
              industry&apos;s ever-changing nature. My experience with learning
              Japanese taught me valuable learning strategies, helping me break
              down technologies and understand syntax. Now, my confidence is at
              its peak, and I am ready to approach new challenges.

              My goal? Right now, to join an inclusive, innovative, and
              progressive team that values tech and soft skills to reach its
              goals. My ultimate dream goal? To combine my love of Japan and
              coding into a fulfilling career that makes a positive impact. This
              could mean bridging a gap between tech worlds on a global scale,
              allowing me to continuously improve and use my communication
              skills. So, if you&apos;re looking for an inquisitive software
              developer with a superb work ethic and some questionable skills in
              Karaoke (in Japanese, of course!), drop me a message!
