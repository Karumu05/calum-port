# My Portfolio Site

I wanted to create this website to showcase myself and any projects I work on. Having a portfolio will allow me to track my progress and see any gaps in where I can improve my coding skills. This project will be a continuous work in progress for the rest of my life, implementing new features continuously and using it as a base testing ground for practising CSS and TypeScript skills. 

## Methodology

I intend this project to follow AGILE methodologies to practice and become used to the processes. 
Now, I have created the primary site under the following sprints:

1. Create a basic plan structure for the site
2. Create a homepage for the site
3. Create a project section of the site focusing on dynamic routing
4. Create about me section of the site

I want to develop my portfolio site further over time. 

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

As pointed out above, the MVP includes the above bullet points. I also intended the MVP to be designed primarily for desktop, laptop, and large-screen devices. 

Due to this, I understand that the layout and design on smaller screens will have some bugs.

### Going Forward

I intend to develop this site continuously, but for now, the key sprints I wish to work on and achieve are:

- Making the site usable for smaller devices

- Cleaning my source code:
-- moving anything that can be into individual components 
-- Adding loading screens/skeletons
-- Ensuring all utility functions are separated into a file and exported and imported correctly

- Learning how to create professional animations using CSS / Tailwind and implementing them across the site.
- Potentially Adding more user interactivity features such as comment sections, like buttons
